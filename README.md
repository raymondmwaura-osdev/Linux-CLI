# Linux CLI

This repository contains notes about the Linux command-line interface (CLI). It covers commands (for example, `cd`, `ip`, `ldd`), shells (such as `bash` and `zsh`), terminal emulators (such as `alacritty` and `kitty`), shell scripting, and related topics.

The notes are not organized in a strict order. However, file and directory names are clear and descriptive.

If you find incorrect or outdated information, or if you want to suggest new topics, feel free to open an issue.
